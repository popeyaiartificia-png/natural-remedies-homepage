## Slide 5: Current Website Analysis — Critical Issues

We conducted a thorough analysis of naturalremedy.com and identified **4 Critical** and **2 Moderate** gaps:

### Critical Issue 1: WordPress + Elementor Stack

The current website runs on WordPress with Elementor page builder. This creates heavy page loads, slow Core Web Vitals, and a dated user experience. The client needs a modern Next.js rebuild hosted on AWS.

### Critical Issue 2: No CRM or Lead Automation

The contact page uses only email addresses. There is no automated lead routing, no follow-up sequences, and zero pipeline visibility across their 5 business divisions.

### Critical Issue 3: Zero AEO / AI Search Presence

No structured data, no FAQ schema, no entity optimization. Natural Remedies is completely invisible to ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews — a massive missed opportunity in 2025/2026.

### Critical Issue 4: No AI Chatbot or Product Finder

Visitors browsing 12+ products across multiple animal species have no guided experience. Only static Elementor pages and a basic feedback widget exist.

---

## Slide 6: Current Website Analysis — Moderate Issues

### Moderate Issue 1: 20+ Country WPML Subdomains

Maintaining separate WordPress sites per country using WPML is costly, inconsistent, and hard to manage. A unified i18n architecture would be far more efficient.

### Moderate Issue 2: Underutilized R&D Content

Natural Remedies has a 25,000 sq.ft R&D center with 100+ scientists and 30 years of research papers. This incredible asset is not being showcased effectively on their website, missing a major trust-building and authority opportunity.

---
