description: "Use when adding interactive 3D scenes from Spline.design to web projects. Covers embedding methods (React, Next.js, vanilla JS), the @splinetool/ runtime API for programmatic control (events, variables, animations, camera), performance optimization, mobile fallbacks, and common integration problems like scroll hijacking, layout shift, GPU fallbacks, and watermark removal."

# Spline 3D Integration Skill

Master guide for embedding interactive 3D scenes from [Spline.design](https://spline.design) into web projects.

---

## Quick Reference

| Task | Guide |
|---|---|
| Vanilla HTML/JS embed | [guides/VANILLA_INTEGRATION.md](guides/VANILLA_INTEGRATION.md) |
| React / Next.js / Vue embed | [guides/REACT_INTEGRATION.md](guides/REACT_INTEGRATION.md) |
| Performance & mobile optimization | [guides/PERFORMANCE.md](guides/PERFORMANCE.md) |
| Debugging & common problems | [guides/COMMON_PROBLEMS.md](guides/COMMON_PROBLEMS.md) |

## Working Examples

| File | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [examples/vanilla-embed.html](examples/vanilla-embed.html) | Minimal vanilla JS embed with background + fallback |
| [examples/react-spline-wrapper.tsx](examples/react-spline-wrapper.tsx) | Production-ready lazy-loaded React wrapper with fallback |
| [examples/interactive-scene.tsx](examples/interactive-scene.tsx) | Full interactive example: events, object control, camera |

## What Is Spline?

Spline is a browser-based 3D design tool — think Figma, but for 3D. Designers create interactive 3D scenes (objects, materials, animations, physics, events) in the Spline editor, then export them for the web via a hosted `.splinecode` file URL.

---

## STEP 1 — Identify the Stack

Before writing any code, check the existing project files to determine the framework.

| Stack | Method |
|---|---|
| Vanilla HTML/JS | `<spline-viewer>` web component OR `@splinetool/runtime` |
| React / Vite | `@splinetool/react-spline` |
| Next.js | `@splinetool/react-spline/next` |
| Vue | `@splinetool/vue-spline` |
| iframe (Webflow, Notion, etc.) | Public URL iframe |

---

## STEP 2 — Get the Scene URL

The user must go to their Spline editor → **Export** → **Code Export** → copy the `prod.spline.design` URL:

```
https://prod.spline.design/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/scene.splinecode
```

**Before copying the URL, tell the user to check Play Settings:**
- ✅ Toggle **Hide Background** ON if the site has a dark or custom background
- ✅ Toggle **Hide Spline Logo** ON if they have a paid plan
- ✅ Set **Geometry Quality** to Performance for faster load
- ✅ Disable **Page Scroll**, **Zoom**, **Pan** if those aren't needed (reduces hijacking risk)
- ✅ Click **Generate Draft** or **Promote to Production** after any settings change — the URL does NOT auto-update

## STEP 3 — Read the Relevant Guide

Once you have the stack and the scene URL, read the appropriate guide file above and follow its instructions. Always read COMMON_PROBLEMS.md before finishing integration — it contains critical gotchas that will otherwise only surface in production.
